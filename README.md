## Crude_Oil_Production_Forecasting - Time Series - AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA

Crude oil production is considered one of the most important indicators of the global economy. 

Crude oil production forecasting is an important input into the decision-making process and investment scenario evaluation, which are crucial for oil-producing countries. Governments and businesses spend a lot of time and resources figuring out the production forecast that can help to identify opportunities and decide on the best way forward.

Objective - In this case study, we will analyze and use historical oil production data, from 1992 to 2018, for a country to forecast its future production. We need to build a time series forecasting model using the AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast oil production.
